-- | An effect system with rows, written by hand (used by example D).
--
-- A computation of type @Eff es a@ may use the effects in the list @es@
-- (the "row"). A function that is polymorphic in @es@ and asks for
-- @Member Net es@ works in any row that contains Net: that is row
-- polymorphism. A handler removes one effect from the row and interprets
-- it; when the row is empty, the computation is pure.
--
-- It is a minimal version of what libraries such as effectful, polysemy or
-- fused-effects do, and languages such as Koka. It needs several
-- extensions: the row is a type-level list.
